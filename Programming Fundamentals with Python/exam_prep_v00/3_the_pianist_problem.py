# You are a pianist, and you like to keep a list of your favorite piano pieces. Create a program to help you organize 
# it and add, change, remove pieces from it!
# On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer n â€“ the number of pieces you will initially have. 
# On the next n lines, the pieces themselves will follow with their composer and key, 
# separated by "|" in the following format: "{piece}|{composer}|{key}".
#
# Then, you will be receiving different commands, each on a new line, separated by 
# "|", until the "Stop" command is given:
# "Add|{piece}|{composer}|{key}":
# You need to add the given piece with the information about it to the other pieces and print:
# "{piece} by {composer} in {key} added to the collection!"
# If the piece is already in the collection, print:
# "{piece} is already in the collection!"
# "Remove|{piece}":
# If the piece is in the collection, remove it and print:
# "Successfully removed {piece}!"
# Otherwise, print:
# "Invalid operation! {piece} does not exist in the collection."
# "ChangeKey|{piece}|{new key}":
# If the piece is in the collection, change its key with the given one and print:
# "Changed the key of {piece} to {new key}!"
# Otherwise, print:
# "Invalid operation! {piece} does not exist in the collection."
# Upon receiving the "Stop" command, you need to print all pieces in your collection, sorted by their name and 
# by the name of their composer in alphabetical order, in the following format:
# "{Piece} -> Composer: {composer}, Key: {key}"
