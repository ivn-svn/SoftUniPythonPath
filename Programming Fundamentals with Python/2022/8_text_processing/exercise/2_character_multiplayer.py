# Create a program that receives two strings on a single line separated by a single space. Then, it prints the sum of
# their multiplied character codes as follows: multiply str1[0] with str2[0] and add the result to the total sum,
# then continue with the next two characters.
# If one of the strings is longer than the other,
# add the remaining character codes to the total sum without multiplication.
