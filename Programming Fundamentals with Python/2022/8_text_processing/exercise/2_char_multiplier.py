# Character Multiplier
# Create a program that receives two strings on a single line separated by a single space. 
# Then, it prints the sum of their multiplied character codes as follows: 

# multiply str1[0] with str2[0] and add the result to the total sum, then continue 
# with the next two characters. 
# If one of the strings is longer than the other, add the remaining character codes
#  to the total sum without multiplication.
user_input = input().split(' ')
sum_of_multiplied = [x = 0 for  x += ord(user_input[x]) in user_input[0]]
print(sum_of_multiplied)
