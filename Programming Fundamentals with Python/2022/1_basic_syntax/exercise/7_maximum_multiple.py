# â€¢	Maximum Multiple
# On the first line, you will be given a positive number, 
# which will serve as a divisor. On the second line, you will receive a
#  positive number that will be the boundary. You should find the largest integer N, that is:
# 	â€¢	 divisible by the given divisor
# 	â€¢	  less than or equal to the given bound
# 	â€¢	 greater than 0
# Note: it is guaranteed that N is found.
