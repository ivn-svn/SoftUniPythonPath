# Lookaround	Name	What it Does
# (?=foo)	Lookahead	        | Asserts that what immediately follows the current position in the string is foo
# (?<=foo)	Lookbehind	        | Asserts that what immediately precedes the current position in the string is foo
# (?!foo)	Negative Lookahead	| Asserts that what immediately follows the current position in the string is not foo
# (?<!foo)	Negative Lookbehind	| Asserts that what immediately precedes the current position in the string is not foo
# With lookarounds, your feet stay planted on the string. You're just looking, not moving!
