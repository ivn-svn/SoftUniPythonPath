# 	Capitals
# Using a dictionary comprehension, write a program that receives country names on the first line, 
# separated by comma and space ", ", and their corresponding capital cities on the second line 
# (again separated by comma and space ", "). Print each country with their capital on a separate 
# line in the following format: "{country} -> {capital}".
country = ''
capital = ''
# dict_variable = {key:value for (key,value) in dictonary.items()}
