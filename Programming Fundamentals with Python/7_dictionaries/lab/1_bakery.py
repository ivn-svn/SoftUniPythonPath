# This is your first task in your new job. You were tasked to create a list of the stock in a bakery and you really
# don't want to fail at you first day at work.
# You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities '
# '(values). They will be separated by a single space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value and so on).'
# ' Create a dictionary with all the keys and values and print it on the console
# elements = input().split(" ")
# bakery = {} # bakery = dict()
# for i in range(0, len(elements), 2):
#     key = elements[i]
#     value = elements[i + 1]
#     bakery[key] = int(value)
# print(bakery)
# #
# products = {}
# #
# data = input()
# elements = data.split(" ")
# for index in range(0, len(elements), 2):
#     product_name = elements[index]
#     product_quantity = elements[index + 1]
#     products[product_name] = int(product_quantity)
# #
# print(products)

# bakery_str = input()
