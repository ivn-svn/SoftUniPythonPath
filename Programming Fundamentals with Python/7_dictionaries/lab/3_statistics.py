# 3. Statistics
# # You seem to be doing great at your first job. You have now successfully completed the first 2 of your tasks and your
# # boss decides to give you as your next task something more challenging. You have to accept all the new products coming
# # in the bakery and finally gather some statistics.
# # You will be receiving key-value pairs on separate lines separated by ": " until you receive the command "statistics".
# # Sometimes you may receive a product more than once. In that case you have to add the new quantity to the existing one.
# # When you receive the "statistics" command, print the following:
# # "Products in stock:
# # - {product1}: {quantity1}
# # - {product2}: {quantity2}
# # â€¦
# # Total Products: {count_all_products}
# # Total Quantity: {sum_all_quantities}"

            quantity = products_quantities_dict[product]
