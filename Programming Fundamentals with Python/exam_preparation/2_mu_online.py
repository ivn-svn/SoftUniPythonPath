# "potion"
# You are healed with the number in the second part. But your health cannot exceed your initial health (100).
# First print: "You healed for {amount} hp.".
# After that, print your current health: "Current health: {health} hp.".
# "chest"
# You've found some bitcoins, the number in the second part.
# Print: "You found {amount} bitcoins."
# In any other case you are facing a monster, you are going to fight.
# The second part of the room, contains the attack of the monster.
# You should remove the monster's attack from your health.
# If you are not dead (health <= 0) you've slain the monster, and you should print ("You slayed {monster}.")
# If you've died, print "You died! Killed by {monster}." and your quest is over. Print the best room you`ve manage' \
#       ' to reach: "Best room: {room}".
# If you managed to go through all the rooms in the dungeon, print on the next three lines:
# "You've made it!", "Bitcoins: {bitcoins}", "Health: {health}".
