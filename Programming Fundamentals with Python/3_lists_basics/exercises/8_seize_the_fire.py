# Create a program that calculates the water needed to put out a "fire cell", based on the given information about its
# "fire level" and how much it gets affected by water.
#
# First, you will be given the level of fire inside the cell with the integer value of the cell,
# which represents the needed water to put out the fire.  They will be given in the following format:

# "{typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}#{typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}# â€¦ {typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}"
# Afterward you will receive the amount of water you have for putting out the fires. There is a range of fire
# for each fire type, and if a cell's value is below or exceeds it, it is invalid, and you do not need to put it out.
