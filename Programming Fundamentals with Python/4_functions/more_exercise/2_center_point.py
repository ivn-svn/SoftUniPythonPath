# You will be given the coordinates of two points on a Cartesian coordinate system - X1, Y1, X2,
# and Y2 on separate lines. Write a function that prints the point which is closest to the center
# of the coordinate system (0, 0) in the format: "({X}, {Y})"
# If the points are at the same distance from the center, print only the first one.
# The resulting coordinates must be formatted to the lower integer.
