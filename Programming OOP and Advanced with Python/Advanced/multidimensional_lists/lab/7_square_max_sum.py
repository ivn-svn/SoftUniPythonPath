# Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and finds the 2x2 top-left submatrix with biggest sum of its values. 
# On first line you will get matrix sizes in format "{rows}, {columns}".  On the next rows, you will get elements for each column, separated with a comma and a space ", ". 
# You should print the found submatrix and the sum of its elements, as shown in the examples. 

# 3, 6
# 7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1
# 1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6
# 4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0
# 2, 4
# 10, 11, 12, 13
# 14, 15, 16, 17
