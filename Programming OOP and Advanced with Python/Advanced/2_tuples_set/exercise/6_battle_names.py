# You will receive a number N. On the following N lines, you will be receiving names. 
# You should sum the ASCII values of each letter in the name and integer divide it by 
# the number of the current row (starting from 1). 
# Save the result to a set of either odd or even numbers, depending on if the resulting number is odd or even. 
# After that, sum the values of each set.
# •	If the sums of the two sets are equal, print the union of the values, separated by ", ". 
# •	If the sum of the odd numbers is bigger than the sum of the even numbers, print the different values, separated by ", ".
# •	If the sum of the even numbers is bigger than the sum of the odd numbers, print the symmetric-different values, separated by ", ".
# NOTE: On every operation, the starting set should be the odd set
